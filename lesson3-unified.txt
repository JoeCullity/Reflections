- Branches  - An offshoot of the current repository on your local drive that can be merged back to the
              origenal branch
- clones    - Takes a repository (referenced by it's URL) and clones it to youyr local drive)
- Forks     - Makes a copy on GitHub from one repository to YOUR copy of the repository and lets the
              origenal owner know you took a copy of his/her repository.

A while ago my recipe directory on GitHub get trashed, so we renamed that
project out of harms way and are redoing lesson 3 from scratrch.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 A - You might not be ready for changes. or might not want to be disturbed by them.


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A - When I'm working on more then one computer
  B - When I working with other people
  C - As a backup incase my computer crashes and info on my hard disk is worthless

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  A - You only need to pull down the changed files, instead of pulling down the entire repository and sifting threw it looking for changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 A - E_Mail files back and forth - or - explain over the phone what changes I made.
 B - Git definatly prevents errors and helps detect conflics, but the old fashin here's the new file was kind of simple and easy to understand.
