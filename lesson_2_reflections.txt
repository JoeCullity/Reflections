What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Creates a hidden directory under the current directory called ".git" and sets up an EMPTY repository to track whatever you want to track in the current directoy (and it/s sub directorys?)
	

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The "staging area" is an imaginary area (in reality, just a list of file specs)  the "working directly" is where the actual files are stored. (well, OK even the concept of a directoy is a kind of imagenary thing, but...)

	Having a commit work on the “Staging Area” allows you to control which files are committed.
