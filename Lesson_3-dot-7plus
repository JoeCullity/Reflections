2015-12-26 (Still) but from GutHub - the Remoter reposatory, to see if I can pull this file back down

A while ago my recipe directory on GitHub get trashed, so we renamed that
project out of harms way and are redoing lesson 3 from scratrch.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 A - You might not be ready for changes. or might not want to be disturbed by them.


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A - When I'm working on more then one computer
  B - When I working with other people
  C - As a backup incase my computer crashes and info on my hard disk is worthless
